## Introduction
This project tackles the task of detecting and recognizing multi-digit sequences from images using a two-stage object detector — Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. The model is trained on a COCO-style dataset and supports digit localization (bounding boxes) and sequence reconstruction (digit string output). Implemented in PyTorch and tested on Kaggle, this solution achieves strong performance on both object detection and structured recognition tasks.

## How to install
Run on Kaggle Notebooks.
